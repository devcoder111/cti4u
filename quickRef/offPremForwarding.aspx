        <strong>NOTE:</strong> This feature is not a system default. Off premise call forwarding
        for each phone needs to be authorized by your System Administrator and pre-programmed
        by a technician. You will hear three beeps or a fast busy sound on step 2 if your
        phone is not programmed for off premise call forwarding. See your system administrator
        for authorization for CTI to program as needed.</p>
