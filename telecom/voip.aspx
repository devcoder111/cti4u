        Not sure what VoIP is and why it's the right choice for your business? You're not
        alone. Many business owners have heard about VoIP, but aren't really sure how it
        applies to them. Put simply, VoIP allows you to combine your voice, data and video
        into a single, easily managed service.
    </p>
    <h3 title="Why VoIP?">
        Why VoIP? It's the first step toward greater efficiency and productivity
    </h3>
    <p>
        Before we start talking about why VoIP is such a great way to go, we should probably
        review what we mean by "VoIP" in the first place, as well as "Unified Communications."
    </p>
    <p>
        Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows you to have your phone line on an IP
        network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unified Communications offers the power of VoIP combined with a secure network.
        Combining all of your communications, including voice, data and video, you can enjoy
        an easy-to-use business solution that is full of features and just works, and it's
        quite cost-effective.
    </p>
    <h3 title="VoIP helps you focus on your business">
        VoIP helps you focus on what matters: your business.
    </h3>
    <p>
        VoIP is a powerful tool for maintaining a competitive edge. Once you switch to an
        IP-based Unified Communications system you'll experience increased productivity
        as a result of combining and simplifying your communication tools. Your voice and
        data will be secure, and you'll make it easier for your employees to maintain access
        to your network, whether at work or at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your business will receive many additional features without associated extra fees,
        including voicemail, caller ID, conferencing, call forwarding and unlimited long
        distance.
    </p>
    <h3 title="VoIP: Cuts costs and improves communication">
        How VoIP helps you cut costs and improve communication with customers and employees
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using tools like online conferencing, screen sharing and video calls reduces need
            to travel to location </li>
        <li>Adding extra phone lines is easy, because VoIP lets you send multiple phone calls
            across your IP network </li>
        <li>Your employees will have more ways to stay connected </li>
        <li>By using &quot;presence&quot; technology, you'll be able to see if your employees
            are available and how to get in touch with them </li>
        <li>Voicemail delivered directly to your email</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When people hear Voice over IP or VoIP they sometimes think that they can utilize
        their existing internet connection and make all calls for free. This is not necessarily
        true. They CAN use their existing internet connection, but you must also have an
        ITSP (Internet Service Provider) to provide the service over the internet. You can
        get rid of your local voice service provider, but you will still need a provider
        for the VoIP lines, called SIP trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
        VoIP has a few different applications that it can be used for. If you just want
        to lower LD charges and save money by using SIP trunks, that is one application.
        This can often be done by using a SIP gateway connected to a legacy phone system,
        a VoIP phone system isnâ€™t required.
    </p>
    <h3 title="Utilizing VoIP functionality">
        Utilizing VoIP functionality
    </h3>
    <p>
        Having a VoIP phone server/system is another way of using VoIP. But even if you
        have a pure IP phone system, you can still use traditional types of local service
        such as PRI or even analog lines from traditional service providers. In this case,
        the IP phone system would reside on the your local network so internally it would
        be VoIP, but externally to make and receive calls it is not. However, if you have
        multiple locations, or remote workers or offices, IP phones can utilize the internet
        to connect to the main system. This is another form of using VoIP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even without a pure IP phone system, many of the newer digital systems support IP
        phones and/or SIP trunks, so you can still get VoIP functionality without the need
        for a forklift upgrade to your phone system.

        So why VoIP from Communications Technology, Inc.?
        <br />
        Because it gives you technology that's just your size. And with Unified Communications<br />
        you'll spend less time focusing on technology and more time focusing on what matters<strong>
            - your business.</strong>
