        A business telephone system is any of a range of a multiline telephone systems typically
        used in business environments, encompassing systems ranging from small key systems
        to large scale private branch. A business telephone system differs from simply using
        a telephone with multiple lines in that the lines used are accessible from multiple
        telephones, or "stations" in the system, and that such a system often provides additional
        features related to call handling.
