            Hassle-Free Hosted VoIP Your phone system should help your business solve problems, not create new ones.

A FreedomIQ hosted VoIP PBX system is guaranteed to stop the headaches and unnecessary expense. With “plug-and-play” VoIP phones and a broadband Internet connection, your business can be up-and-running with reliable, hassle-free VoIP phone service within minutes.
