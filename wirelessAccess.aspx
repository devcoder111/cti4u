        Ruckus Wireless&trade; has been designing, manufacturing, and marketing Smart Wi-Fi products and Smart Wireless LAN (WLAN) systems ever since they first opened their doors back in June of 2004. Their patented, universe-leading Wi-Fi technology was just one reason they were named a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum. Privately-owned, they've had some $51 million invested in their company from some of the world's leading venture firms, including Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill, T-Ventures, Investor AB, Focus Ventures, and Motorola Ventures.
