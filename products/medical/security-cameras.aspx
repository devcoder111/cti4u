    <p>Whether it's a clinic, a hospital, or a doctor's office, video surveillance is a valuable security tool for healthcare institutions of all sizes, helping patients, doctors, and staff to focus on treatment.</p>
    <p>CTI understands there are benefits and risks of video surveillance in the medical office.  While video surveillance will protect patient's medical records, medical office supplies and allows for 24/7 remote monitoring, video surveillance in the medical office is risky since patient and doctor privacy must be protected at all times.  </p>
    <p>CTI has the knowledge and experience to configure an effective and safe video surveillance for your facility while preserving privacy.</p>
