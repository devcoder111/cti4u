    <img src="/images-content/mlc.jpg" alt="Multi-line Client (MLC)" class="imgRight" />
    <p>Mobile devices are becoming the primary communications method for most of today&rsquo;s on-the-go workforce. Along with this expanded use of mobile phones for business comes the challenge of remaining connected and effective, without the functionality of a networked telephone.  Weak in-building signals can also be an issue. Moving the call to an outdoor location can make continuing the conversation very difficult- and important calls can even be lost. Today, positive customer interaction and smooth business communications are critical to the success of any enterprise. NEC&rsquo;s Multiline Client Mobile gives both customers and colleagues easy access to your mobile personnel, while also providing your people with the business tools they need to work effectively while they are on the go.</p>

    <h3 class="allcaps" id="digitalDect">Digital Dect Terminals</h3>
    <p>Combines the advantages of digital telephony with the superior quality and advanced features of DECT technology.</p>
    <p>NEC's UNIVERGE SV9000 Series Digital DECT Terminals combine the best of both worlds. In the process, they help organizations unify their business communications to become more mobile.</p>
    <p>NEC's Digital DECT phones work seamlessly with NEC's UNIVERGE SV8000 Series communications servers. Installing Digital DECT is easy, and both data and network remain secure. All communications are encrypted to protect the privacy of the company and its customers.</p>
    <p>By adding a DTL-RPT-1 repeater to the system, the coverage area of the Digital DECT telephone system can be extended in all directions &ndash; including vertically. The repeaters are installed so their coverage area overlaps the coverage area of the base - then the base hands-off calls to the repeaters as employees move from one coverage area to another. When connected to the repeater, the mobile handset operates exactly as it does when connected to the base. Users never perceive handoffs from the base to a repeater - even during an active call.</p>
    <p>This Digital DECT wireless system provides the workforce with perfect voice quality, seamless handoffs and a secure air interface. A company's investments in its existing telephones, applications and network infrastructure are secure.</p>

    <h3 id="uMobility"><span class="allcaps">Fixed Mobile Convergence</span> (uMobility)</h3>
    <p>Mobile phones are a mainstay in today's businesses and usage only continues to grow. This inherently makes employees have to distribute a separate phone number to business associates or customers so they can be reached and manage multiple voice mailboxes, as well as deal with important calls being dropped from a weak in-building signal.</p>
    <p>With NEC's fixed mobile convergence uMobility&trade; solution from Varaha Systems, Inc., businesses are now able to provide employees with single number reach, unified voice messaging and enhanced in-building coverage through a business's Wi-Fi network. uMobility provides:</p>

        <li><strong>Single number reach</strong> &ndash; rings a user's business phone and cell phone simultaneously ensuring no calls are missed</li>
        <li><strong>Unified voice messaging</strong> &ndash; all missed calls are directed to a user's business voicemail account; centralizing messages in one mailbox</li>
        <li><strong>Seamless roaming on and off campus</strong> &ndash; calls can be transparently bridged from a business's Wi-Fi to cellular networks and back again via a Smartphone</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise dialing via Smartphones</strong> &ndash; enables users to do station-to-station and external dialing; calls can be placed by either entering a 4 or 5 digit extension or a fully-dialed number</li>
        <li><strong>Improved efficiency and productivity</strong> &ndash; provides users the capability to handle calls more promptly; streamlining communications and information delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Increased customer satisfaction</strong> &ndash; provides customers with a single number to reach their contact on the first try; positively impacting customer service dramatically</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By enabling employees to be reached anytime, anywhere &ndash; any business can become more efficient, responsive, collaborative and productive.</p>
