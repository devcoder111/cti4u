                        <b>BURTON, MI</b> &ndash;
                        We have merged with ProTech Communications, a voice services company, in order to expand CTI's abilities to serve its customers even better. Jeff Allen, President of CTI, has been working very closely with both Gary Antrobius and Richard Stewart over the past several months in order to ensure a seamless transfer of ownership, which has resulted in a very smooth transition. Antrobius and Stewart have decided to remain onboard at CTI, in order to make sure that their customers receive the same high-level of service that they have grown to appreciate over the years. CTI is focused on leveraging all of its technological expertise to expand on the positive contributions that Pro-Tech has offered to their customers and to help them gain a competitive advantage in their respective industries.
                    </p>

                    <p>"We feel so fortunate to be working with such a talented group of individuals," states Jeff Allen, President of CTI. "One of the things that Gary and Richard emphasized early on, was the highexpectations of customer service. Everyone spent plenty of time assessing strengths making sure that this was the right fit for everyone involved." Antroubius and Stewart interviewed several potential merger candidates, yet CTI clearly emerged as the most intelligent choice.</p>
