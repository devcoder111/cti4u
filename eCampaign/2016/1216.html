                                <p>While the US economy is still reeling from the recent financial turmoil, small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are driving the economic recovery. In today's marketplace, the Internet is their gas pedal. Everything, ranging from website marketing to online transactions to web-based meetings to industry research is taking place online. While the Internet has presented businesses with access to an unstinted array of resources, it also brings several dangers. We're all familiar with many of the standard security threats - viruses, SPAM, malware, spyware, etc. - but as technology continues to evolve, business owners face an entirely new set of issues. What are my employees actually doing with their time? Are my employees putting my business at risk? How can I protect my business from internal risks, external risks and risks I haven't even heard of yet?  </p>
                                <p>Many business owners are able to monitor employee web usage. One of the most prevalent issues facing business owners is the decrease in productivity due to the proliferation of social networking sites, such as Facebook or Myspace. When you walk by in the hallway and see your employees working diligently at their computers, they could very well be flipping through the pictures of their friend's most recent Vegas trip, or chatting online with other friends. Web monitoring software is an easy fix to this type of problem. </p>
